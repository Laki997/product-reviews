# Product Reviews service

Architecture for managing products and reviews with real-time average rating calculations and intelligent caching.

## My thoughts

This application was fun to create. I think it covers a lot of stuff for such small app, we touched db, orm for database, server, docker, caching, brokers, etc..I used express because its easy to setup, postgres and prisma for db stuff as I usualy do, redis for caching and rabitmq works well with node and I dont have chance to work with it that much, I am always using SQS and Kafka on projects. For product service I created controller, service, repository layers.

If i was doing it all over again I would maybe change some stuff. I would maybe handle prisma diferently, would maybe extract it in different package and then use it in both services. This way we are copying client to other servie which is okay, but for example in schema we needed to add binaryTargets because of that. Similarly maybe with redis. I also had issue with rabbitmq because it takes a lot of time to boot and then services fail because they depend on it. I think I had same issue with that 2 or 3 years ago, I built almost same application, its on my Github I can show it later, that helped me to remember so I added some conditions like depends on and healthchecks in docker compose. Also regarding scaling of review-processing-service I think it can be done in multiple ways, the way I have done it with container replicas, with node Cluster module or in some way with worker threads, not sure If this solution is what was looked for.

Regarding next steps here I would add some unit and integration testing with jest and supertest, I would create ci cd pipeline to run test, build code, etc..In the end maybe we can add some UI to this as some dashboard.

Wanted to mention that I have used Cursor for some stuff like creating seeds to populate db, adding nice logs with emojis since its little hard to track logs in container, this way I clearly see what has been done and also for generating readme docs.

In the end, as I said I would maybe change some things and proceed with some new one mentioned, but what is improtant is that we have working solution. Let me know what you think!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This application consists of two services working together:

### **Product Service** (Port 3000)

- **RESTful API** for products and reviews management
- **Event Publisher** - publishes review events to RabbitMQ
- **Caching Layer** - caches products and reviews for fast responses
- **Database Operations** - handles all CRUD operations

### **Review Processing Service** (2 Instances)

- **Event Consumer** - listens to review events from RabbitMQ
- **Average Rating Calculator** - calculates and updates product average ratings
- **Cache Manager** - updates Redis cache with fresh data
- **Concurrent Processing** - handles multiple events simultaneously

### **Infrastructure**

- **PostgreSQL** - primary database
- **Redis** - caching layer
- **RabbitMQ** - message broker for event-driven communication

## üîÑ How It Works

### **1. Product Management**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+

### Setup Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd product-service
npm install

cd ../review-processing-service
npm install

# 2. Start all services
docker-compose up --build

# 3. Setup database
docker-compose exec product-service npm run db:push
docker-compose exec product-service npm run db:seed
```

## ÔøΩÔøΩ API Endpoints

### Products

```http
GET    /api/products          # Get all products with average ratings
GET    /api/products/{id}     # Get product by ID
POST   /api/products          # Create product
PUT    /api/products/{id}     # Update product
DELETE /api/products/{id}     # Delete product
```

### Reviews

```http
GET    /api/reviews/product/{productId}  # Get product reviews
GET    /api/reviews/{id}                # Get review by ID
POST   /api/reviews                     # Create review (triggers event)
PUT    /api/reviews/{id}                # Update review (triggers event)
DELETE /api/reviews/{id}                # Delete review (triggers event)
```

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Caching Strategy

### Cache Keys

- **`product:{id}`** - Individual product with average rating (1 hour)
- **`reviews:{id}`** - Product reviews (30 minutes)
- **`products:all`** - All products with average ratings (15 minutes)

### Cache Invalidation

When any review event occurs (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE):

1. Individual product cache updated
2. Product reviews cache updated
3. All products cache refreshed with new average ratings

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Event Processing

### Event Types

- **`REVIEW_CREATED`** - New review added
- **`REVIEW_UPDATED`** - Review modified
- **`REVIEW_DELETED`** - Review removed

## üîß Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `RABBITMQ_URL` - RabbitMQ connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode
- `PORT` - Service port
- `POSTGRES_DB` - Postgres database
- `POSTGRES_USER` - Postgres user
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Postgres password
- `RABITMQ_USER` - Rabitmq user
- `RABITMQ_PASS` - Rabitmq password
